# 🌾 Hill-Climbing Plot Division

A Python-based solution that uses the **Hill-Climbing algorithm** to optimize the division of agricultural land using **soil quality** and **irrigation data**. This is part of a broader intelligent agriculture initiative in your AI course project.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Optimizes land plot division based on heuristic evaluation
- Uses hill-climbing strategy for local search
- Visual output for final division
- Includes supporting files like PPT presentation and crop data

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Projects-2-2/lai/u-1
   ```

2. Run the Python file:
   ```bash
   python plot_division_hill_climbing.py
   ```

3. (Optional) Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook plot-division.ipynb
   ```

---

## 📊 Output

The program generates a visual output showing the optimal plot division based on input soil/irrigation data.

You can view this in:
- `output.png` (static image)
- Or directly from the Python script or notebook

---

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- Use additional AI search algorithms like **Simulated Annealing** or **Genetic Algorithms**
- Add GUI interface for file input and output
- Integrate real-time satellite/GIS data
